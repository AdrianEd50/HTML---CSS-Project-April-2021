<h1>Conscious Coffee</h1>

<p>This is my cross-course project alled Conscious Coffee, where I have made a website about different coffee types and the purpose of the site is for the consumer/customer to pick which offee they want and see information about the spesific coffe the have picked and also to add it to their basket, that they hopfully will buy eventually.</p>

<h2>Description</h2>
<p>My coffee site is set up for the people who loves coffee. I have a bunch of different coffee types that hopefully will be suitable for all people. The use of the site is for a consumer/customer to look for different coofees and hopefully find the one they like and want, if they click on a spesific coffee type information is shown about that spesific type and hopefully after reading about the tpype of coffee they may also want to buy the coffee, by adding it to their basket and eventually buy it, that feature is not available at the moment but it is set up so people can put their item in their basket.</p>

<li>Look for the product you desire</li>
<li>Click the product to see information about it</li>
<li>Hopefully be convinced to wanting to buy it</li>
<li>Add the product to your basket</li>
